• 'final project.R' conducts a ridge regularized logistic regression and LASSO analysis using the glmnet package
• 'final_proj_logistc_reg.R' is a more refined version of the previous R file, featuring comparisons between the logistic regression and LASSO analysis and printouts of important information regarding analysis.
